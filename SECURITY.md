# How to report security vulnerabilities in `libdns`

GitHub has a [mechanism for private disclosure of vulnerabilities](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) to repository owners and authorized persons such as maintainers.  This repository now has this feature enabled.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

See [Privately Reporting a Security Vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).  Click on [Security page](https://github.com/nicowilliams/libdns/security) and click on [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/nicowilliams/libdns/security/advisories/new).  This will notify the owners and maintainers.  After submitting you'll get an option to start a private clone for collaboration with the maintainers.
